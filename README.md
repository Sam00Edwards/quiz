## User Experience (UX)

### Project Goals

The main goal of this project is to showcase and test the users knowledge on a few simple questions about classic literature and their authors.

### Colour Scheme

![Colour scheme image](assets/images/Colour.JPG)

The colours used in this website are mainly cream, black and brown with the main background being an image of parchment to fit the theme.

Many online images and colour scheme references were examined both through google images and pinterest.

### Typography

The site primarily uses 'Lora' as the font of choice with 'Serif' as the back-up option if that doesn't work properly. This font was chosen again because it feels a little vintage and old world and would match the theme of the website.

## Testing

### Code Validation

* The [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/), [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) were used to make sure there were no errors or bugs in the system.

    - W3C Markup Validator found no errors or warnings on my HTML. 
    - W3C CSS Validator found no errors or warnings on my CSS.
    - JS Hint showed me a warning for my 'for' loop on line 22.
    
    ![JS Hint image](assets/images/jshint.JPG)
    - This was easily rectified by adding a 'var' inside the brackets.

### Accessibility

* Used Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools to confirm that it met the necessary accessibility scores.

* Lighthouse reports

* Responsiveness
    
    - [Am I Responsive?](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/#) was used to check responsiveness of the site pages across different devices.
    
    - Chrome DevTools was used to test responsiveness in different screen sizes during the development process.

### Manual Testing

### ReadME

* The outline of this ReadME was based on various examples provided to me by my mentor, Marcel, and my own previous ReadME for the first project. All of the images have been changed and any text that remains identical is text where only a simple explanation is warranted and to change it would be unnecessary.
