![The Book Nook mockup images](assets/readme-files/mockup-image.JPG)

The Book Nook is a fictional book-shop and tea-room located in the heart of Limerick City, at the famous Milk Market.

Using a Dark Academia inspired colour palette and concepts the website aims to show users and customers the numerous different teas, coffees, seasonal treats and cold drinks on offer. Many of the options are caffeine free, gluten free or vegan. 

The Book Nook offers the opportunity to sit by a roaring fire with a cup or pot of tea while reading. Vintage books are also available to purchase, however an appointment must be made ahead of time as they are quite fragile.

## User Experience (UX)

### Project Goals

* Provide a simple and aesthetic website that closely follows the set theme.
* Allow visitors to the website to easily browse through the menu.
* Allow visitors to the website to reserve a seat or book an appointment to view a vintage book.
* Allow visitors to the website to find multiple avenues for contact or to stay up to date on The Book Nooks social media.

### Colour Scheme
![Colour scheme image](assets/readme-files/colour-scheme.JPG)

The colours used in this website are greens, creams and browns with the main background colour being a deep dark green in keeping in line with the dark academia aesthetic. 

Many online images and colour scheme references were examined both through google images and pinterest.

### Typography

The site primarily uses 'Lora' as the font of choice with 'Serif' as the back-up option if that doesn't work properly. This font was chosen again because it feels a little vintage and old world and would match the theme of the website.

### Code

* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) were consulted on a regular basis for inspiration and sometimes to be able to better understand the code being implemented.

### ReadME

* [ReadME file](https://github.com/josswe26/pura-vida-spa/blob/main/README.md) The outline of this ReadME was based on this example provided to me by my mentor, Marcel. All of the images have been changed and any text that remains identical is text where only a simple explanation is warranted and to change it would be unnecessary.
